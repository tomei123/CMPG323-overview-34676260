# CMPG323-overview-34676260

I will use this repository to organize my 323 semester schedule and make a to-do list. Additionally, I will have a well-planned framework with each project's due dates and the estimated duration of each activity. I will try my best to follow the schedule that I planned for myself. I'll also give a brief overview of the branching technique I'll be employing.
